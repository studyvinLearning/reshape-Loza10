My goal with this R project was to not fall back on loops so all of these solutions are done without using loops. This taught me a lot and saved me many lines of code.

1. Sifts through a list of journals from a long time ago and organizes them into a data frame based on certain attributes. Will then count the number of papers published by week and author. Will then create a new data frame to keep track of these values.

2. Cleans a blood pressure dataset on 500 people measured over 63 days. Will reorganize the data to be much more readable. Will then reformat the dates provided to be read as type date by R then will aggregate to get corresponding means.
